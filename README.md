# Code for creating Ecological Niche Models (ENMs) of 5 wild Bovidae species. 
 * *Bos gaurus* (Gaur)
 * *Bos javanicus* (Banteng)
 * *Bubalus arnee* (Wild water buffalo)
 * *Capricornis sumatraensis* (Mainland serow)
 * *Naemorhedus griseus* (Chinese goral)

These codes are contain the some parts of data from the paper: 
"Mapping threatened Thai Bovidae species provides opportunities for improved conservation outcomes in Asia"
(unpublishing paper). 

We were using the package [ENMTML](https://github.com/andrefaa/ENMTML) for model building.

How to use these scripts:
 - download the dataset: [
](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/2/folders/1Zp-2At0YeP9QZKxtOb4yGundLvU4VdFW)
      * containing 2 main folders and subfolder: 
      * 1) data_preparation: dataset use for building the model
            * 
      * 2) result_sample: some results (habitat suitability maps, richness maps) from modelling. This folder contained  3 more subfolders: 
            * 2.1 binary: the result of the binary habitat suitability of the best model
            * 2.2 
 - setwd the working directory
